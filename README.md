# Moshify

As part of the third series of the ultimate html & css course I am going to build a website for a fictional company using the material & information provided to demonstrate my comprehension of the concepts & ability to put those concepts into action. I learned alot from this project, I got more familiar the the BEM naming convention, & had the chance for the first time to get some extensive practice with html and css.
